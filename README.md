### Game Rules

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple two-player game. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three hand gestures:

Rock: a closed fist
Paper: an open hand with fingers extended and touching
Scissors: a partially open hand with the index and middle fingers extended and separated
The winner is determined based on the following rules:

Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)
Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
If both players choose the same shape, the game results in a tie. This digital adaptation allows users to play a single round or a series of rounds against the computer opponent.

### Code Structure

The code for this project is organized into three primary files:

`index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the game, including buttons for user input and areas for displaying results and scores.
`styles.css`: Provides the styling for the game, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
`script.js`: Implements the game's logic, including functions for handling user input, determining the computer's move, comparing moves to determine the winner, and updating the displayed scores and results.

### Stretch Goals

To further enhance the Rock, Paper, Scissors project, consider implementing the following stretch goals:

- Add a settings menu that allows users to choose between different game modes, such as "Best of 3", "Best of 5", or "First to 10".
- Integrate animations and sound effects for a more immersive user experience.
- Implement a mobile-responsive design for improved usability on smartphones and tablets.
- Create a leaderboard system to track high scores and personal bests.
- Add the "Lizard" and "Spock" gestures from the "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" variation, popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory".
